# 2D_Slam

## Project objective
Understand and implement fundamental aspects of the SLAM process. A maze will be generated with an agent within it. The agent will then explore the world mapping it using probabilistic SLAM to determine with a cell is filled or not. A LiDar type sensor is simulated using RayCasting.
